# ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ _**Introduction**_ ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ 
> This Python code is a simple interactive program that generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (*) based on user input. In essence, this code is a fun and interactive way to create diamond patterns while engaging with the user through a simple text-based interface.

# ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ _**Features**_ ðŸ’¢ðŸ’¢ 
- > The code **imports the pyfiglet module** for printing fancy text.
- > The code prints a **welcome message in fancy text** using the pyfiglet module.
- > The code **asks the user** for their name.
- > The code **explains that the program** will ask the user to input an odd integer.
- > The code prompts the user to **continue or exit the program.**
- > The code **generates and prints a diamond pattern** if the input is valid (an odd integer).
- > If the input is invalid (not an odd integer), **it displays an error message.**
- > Finally, it displays a **goodbye message with another stylized text.**
